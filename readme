run_analysis.R merges six data sets (a pair of test and train, defined in the codebook.pdf) into one. The data is assumed to be on the same direcoty as the R file. But not included in GITHUB.


The script then merges the six data sets into one data set, by rbind and cbind, and then subsets into a data set made of subjects, activities, and columns of mean and standard deviation which are constructed by running grep command to search for text: "mean()" or "std()".


A resultant data set made of 68 variables is avchieved. The first two columns are the
subjects and their activities and the remainig 66 columns created are the result of grep search.


An aggregate command is then run to find the new mean for each subject and their activities, by grouping them as such.

The final data frame is a tidy data set made of 180 rows and 68 columns and written into
table and saved as tidy.txt
